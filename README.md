This File will teach you how to use my cleandata.py file. The file takes an excel file as input, and then creates a new excel file.
This new excel file will be generated in the directory that the cleandata.py file is in, this new file will contain select columns from the input file.
The file will ask you what you want to name the output file, and will ask for the path of the input file, make sure that you include the file extension.
I have only tested this program on .xls files, I'm not sure if it will work on .xlsx right now.
